        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p className="fs-5">
          Zen's Time Restaurant builds its own spice-based cuisine around
          British micro-seasonality: vegetables slowly grown for flavour,
          sustainable, line-caught fish and aged native beef. Our kitchen aims
          to serve produce in its optimal state, harnessing as much flavour as
          possible while respecting the true nature of the ingredient.
        </p>
        <p className="fs-5">
          The foundation for our menu is a vast collection of spices with a
          focus on the most well-known and loved dishes from around the world,
          which we have meticulously sourced over the past few years. We explore
          ingredients such as Grains of Selim, a smoky peppercorn with the scent
          of eucalyptus, plantains and scotch bonnet chillies, which we ferment,
          burn and pickle.
